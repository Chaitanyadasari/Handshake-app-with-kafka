# Handshake web app with distributed systems using Kafka and MongoDB
Lab work


# Goals and purpose of the system
To make the system highly distributed and fault tolerance.
The important goal is to make it highly available with more features for the students and employers to interact and get things done.


 # system design 
I used MVC architecture to design the schema and Views to the front end and Controller in the backend. I have one  extra layer of Kafka in the backend to make the response time less and highly available.  With passport and Jwt authentication.

Its highly distributed and used Mongo DB for data storage.

# Results: 
Screen captures of testing results attached above see the report doc

# Performance: 
If you see the performance of my application. It is far better than what we had in the lab 1 as we made it distributive kafka is giving the chance for us to make more connections but quick response time. Jmeter reading says that and without pooling vs pooling as well we see a difference in the graph.
